SendContact:  A simple Android App to send any contact as an SMS.
=================================================================

SendContact is a simple app that allows you to send the primary phone number of any contact on your android phone as an SMS.

This was built for two reasons:
1. Android's default Contacts Manager doesnt have this feature and its a useful one.
2. To learn android development.

Next steps:
-----------
- Widgetize the app
- Beautify the app

Notes:
------
* I went through a phase of expecting to be able to add a new menu item to the existing contact manager's context menu, which is reflected in the original version of the architecture document
* For the most part, the code follows the BusinessCard example from the Android Documentation
* The SMS sending code is essentially taken from [Mobiforge](http://mobiforge.com/developing/story/sms-messaging-android)
* I used the free online book [Learning Android]( http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9781449390501/index.html) to get the basics right. Highly recommended.
